- Document incidents and actions taken

## Common SOC Tools
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- Antivirus / EDR
- Firewall logs
- IDS/IPS
- Threat intelligence platforms

## Types of Security Events
- Failed login attempts
- Malware detections
- Phishing emails
- Unusual network traffic
- Privilege escalation

## SOC Analyst Skills
- Networking knowledge
- Linux fundamentals
- Log analysis
- Incident response basics
- Communication and documentation
