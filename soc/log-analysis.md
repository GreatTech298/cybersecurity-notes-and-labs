# Log Analysis Basics (SOC Lab)

## Objective
To understand how SOC analysts use logs to detect suspicious activity and investigate potential security incidents.

## What Are Logs?
Logs are records of events generated by systems, applications, and security devices.

Examples:
- Authentication logs
- Firewall logs
- Web server logs
- System logs

Logs usually contain:
- Timestamp
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Action taken
- Status (success/failure)

## Example Log Entry

Meaning:
- Date & time: 2026-01-27 10:15:23  
- Event: Failed login  
- User: tobi  
- Source IP: 192.168.1.50  

## Suspicious Patterns
SOC analysts look for:
- Multiple failed logins from one IP
- Logins at unusual hours
- Access from foreign countries
- High number of requests in short time (possible brute force)

## Simple Investigation Scenario
### Scenario:
Multiple failed login attempts detected from one IP address.

Steps:
1. Check how many attempts occurred  
2. Identify the user account targeted  
3. Verify if login was eventually successful  
4. Check IP reputation  
5. Decide response:
   - Block IP  
   - Reset password  
   - Escalate incident  

## Tools Used for Log Analysis
- SIEM (Splunk, ELK)
- Linux logs (`/var/log/auth.log`)
- Windows Event Viewer

## What I Learned
- Logs are the first place to look during an incident  
- Patterns matter more than single events  
- Context is important (time, location, frequency)

## Next Lab
- Brute force detection  
- SIEM basics  
- Alert creation
