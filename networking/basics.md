# Networking Basics for Cybersecurity

## Why Networking Matters
Networking knowledge is essential in cybersecurity because most attacks, detections, and responses happen over networks.

Understanding how devices communicate helps SOC analysts detect abnormal behavior and potential threats.

## Core Concepts

### IP Address
An IP address identifies a device on a network.
- IPv4 example: 192.168.1.1
- IPv6 example: 2001:db8::1

### TCP vs UDP
**TCP**
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable
- Used by HTTP, HTTPS, SSH

**UDP**
- Connectionless
- Faster but less reliable
- Used by DNS, streaming, VoIP

### Common Ports

| Port | Service |
|-----|--------|
| 22 | SSH |
| 80 | HTTP |
| 443 | HTTPS |
| 53 | DNS |

### DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.
Example:
